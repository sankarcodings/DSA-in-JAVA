# DSA-in-JAVA

Project Title: Java DSA Implementations

Description:

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, including:

- Data Structures:
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Trees (BST, AVL, etc.)
    - Graphs
- Algorithms:
    - Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, etc.)
    - Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
    - Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS, etc.)
    - Dynamic Programming

Features:

- Clean and concise code with proper documentation
- Test cases for each implementation
- Comparison of time and space complexity for each algorithm

Technologies Used:

- Java 8 or later

Directory Structure:

- src/main/java: contains the implementation code
- src/test/java: contains the test cases
- docs: contains documentation and explanations for each implementation

How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Import the project into your preferred Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)
3. Run the test cases to verify the implementations
